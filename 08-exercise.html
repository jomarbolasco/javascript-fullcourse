    <h1>lesson 8 exrcise</h1>
    <p>
      8a. Let's say in the amazon project, we have an basketball product. This
      product has a name of 'basketball', a price of 2095 cents. Create an
      object to represent this product and display in the console.
    </p>

    <p>
      8b. Continuing from 8a, Let;s say we want to increase the price by 500
      cents. Use dot notation to increase the price, and display the updated
      object in the console.
    </p>
    <p>
      8c. Using bracket notation, add a property 'delevery-time' to the object
      with the value '3 days', Display the updated object in the console.
    </p>

    <p>
      8d. Create a function 'comparePrice(product1,product2)', which takes 2
      products (with 'name' and 'price' properties) and returns the product that
      is less expensive. Create 2 products and try out the function.
    </p>

    <script>
      //8a
      const product = {
        productName: "basketball",
        price: 2095,
      };

      console.log(product);

      //8b
      product.price += 500;

      console.log(product);

      //8c
      product.deliveryTime = "3 days";
      console.log(product);

      //8d
      function comparePrice(product1, product2) {
        if (product1.price > product2.price) {
          return product1;
        } else {
          return product2;
        }
      }

      const product1 = {
        name: "tanduay",
        price: 170,
      };

      const product2 = {
        name: "Redhorse",
        price: 160,
      };
      console.log(comparePrice(product1, product2));
